We were asked to duplicate a webpage and I did it.  It was complicated learning how to use the gradient for the nav bar, which I didn't do it.  I also learned what I was doing wrong with linking my style.css page as well as incorporating my image.

Although I forgot my glasses and notebook with all my notes, I managed to create the Project Structure from memory!  Things are beginning to sink in!

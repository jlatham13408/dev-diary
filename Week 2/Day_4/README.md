        a. spelling  b. missing characters
  2.  How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today?
        Make a CSS directory and a Styles.css file. Copy the commands inside the <style> tag without copying the <style> tag and paste it into the Style.css file.  Then add the <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> to your pages.  Add the command line to (server.js:  server.use(express.static(__dirname+"/css"));

        Is the space around your content.

        a:hover {
          background-color: #FFF;
          Whenever you hover over the link the color changes to #FFF.
Reflect:  Answer the following questions:

  1.  What was the most frustrating thing about today?
        I actually enjoyed it.
  2.  Why do you think that good code conventions are in place?
        Because it used functions that would change the same class without having to change every single one separately.
  3.  How would you describe the box model to someone that has never seen a computer?
        The first layer of space around your content is the padding
        The second layer of space around your content is the border
        The third layer of space around your content is the margin, which controls the space between the separate contents.

Reflect:  1. Could you make a simple website utilizing what we have learned thus far? Why or why not?  Yes I could.  I have learned the project structure and basic tags to be able to build a simple website.  I have also been working on tutorials that have taught me to do so as well.

2. What do you feel is most difficult to understand about git and the git workflow? I find communicating with github to be the most challenging because I use that the least.  I need to begin keeping a diary every day after class and push it to github so it becomes more comfortable for me. I also don't totally understand why or how it happens.
What is the most interesting thing that you have learned thus far? Everything I have done so far.  Loving the input!

Review: Describe the git workflow up until this point. Be specific about the order and the reason.
What is the difference between <ul> and <ol>? <ul> is un-ordered lists i.e. bullets; <ol> is ordered lists such as numbered lists.
What does the <a> allow you to do with a webpage? I know it is used before the hyper link reference "href".  Not sure what <a> means at this point.

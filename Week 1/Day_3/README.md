Reflect:  Today, Thursday, 1/21/2016 is the third day, but the 2nd day in the lesson.  We have learned so much over the past three days.  I am still understanding a lot, but I feel with more practice I could master the project structure.  I will practice this until it becomes natural to me so I don't have to keep looking at my notes.  This is my assignment for this weekend.

Review: We went through understanding the project structure.  We worked in teams and then had to try on our own.  I enjoyed that because it made me learn a lot by trial and error.

Looking forward to the coming days!

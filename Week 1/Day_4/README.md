Review:  Worked on Project Structure.  I am feeling more comfortable with the working on my own with project structure.  I am learning to rely more on what I can research on Google.  

Reflect:  Sean from the last class stopped by to show us some of things he was working on.  He use to fix musical instruments before coding class.  He only had practice material before starting class.  He starting working immediately after the class.  He contributed his success with his ambition in finding a job.  I am more confident today in my abilities to resolve issues, which is a great thing!

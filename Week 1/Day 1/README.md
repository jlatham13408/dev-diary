Reflect:
The first class was very interesting.  I enjoyed learning new ways to communicate with the computer. I am more confident that I will do well and looking forward to all that I will learn in class as well as outside of class.
Review:
I don't have questions at this time, but rather fully engaged.
git status: tells me the current changes as well as give me an idea of what still needs to be done.
git add: adds the changes and preps me to commit those changes.
git commit: loads my changes to my github.
cd: change directory.
ls: list what's in the current directory.
mkdir: make director, which allows me to create a directory.
touch: allows me to create a file.
